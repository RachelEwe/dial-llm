# dial-llm

A proof of concept to generate dialogs between Pygmalion chatbots.

Can also be used interactively to chat with one bot in command line.

Can be used with [back-llm]([URL_du_lien](https://github.com/RachelEwe/back-llm)https://github.com/RachelEwe/back-llm) backend.

Can support AES with a preshared key (export PSK in .env) so you can use crypted api without using a certificate.

Can also be used with oobabooga or other compatible backend (but without encryption).
